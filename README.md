In the dashboard you will find 6 model fits: Multiple Regression, Ridge Regression, LOESS, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression.
Each of the fits corresponds to a distinct research question we are attempting to answer from the dataset.

are violations broken, what does the model fit results tell us?
